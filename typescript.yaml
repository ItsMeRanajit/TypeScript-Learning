---> every js file is a tsx file, js is a subset of tsx
---> so tsx provides few rules that helps to make the code more organizable and less error prone
---> large projects prefers tsx

1. datatypes -- js (no), tsx(yes)
2. code compilation - js dont includes compilation, but for tsx it needs compilation, bcz browsers dont know tsx so in compilation process the tsx in converted in js, and additionnal errors are checked

3. type - checking
4. code completion 
5. refactoring'
6. few more features like shorthand notations



---> Drawbacks

1. additional compilation step
2. discipline in writing code
